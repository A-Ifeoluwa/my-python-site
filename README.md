# 🎉 IFEOLUWA's Azure Web App Project

Welcome to my very first cloud-based web application! 🚀 This project is a simple HTML + Python Flask-based web app, deployed to **Azure App Service** and served live from the cloud 🌥️✨.

## 💡 About the Project

This is a personal learning project where I:

- Designed a basic HTML page with a birthday greeting and image 🥳
- Built a small Flask backend using Python 🐍
- Learned to use GitHub for **CI/CD** 🚀
- Deployed the app to **Azure Web App** (and later tried out **Azure Container Apps**)
